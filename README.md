Edit summary:
I've added a lot of junk to the code and made the entire phrase generator random.
It feels better to my taste and the droid I'm building.

You can see the simulated version at Wokwi here: https://wokwi.com/projects/408684297004110849
Also, I've added a potentiometer to fine tune the time of each chirp and LEDs to see which part is rolling.
